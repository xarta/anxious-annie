I had this set as a private repository as it's just a mess right now.  But it's the only C# I really have to show other than tests and practice exercises.

By December 2016, I realised I really needed to document more of what I was doing, and so after Christmas Holidays began working on my website instead.  My (self-hosted) website still needs work finishing - especially my WordPress SyntaxHighlighter plug-in.  When my partner went to Egypt I took advantage of the timing to work on my home network - which again took longer than expected (problems including spanning-tree over WDS, and no SNI for server-farms ... which confused me as it seemed anti-idomatic ... I checked the SSL Extension with wireshark in the end to see for myself) ... anyway ... haven't had time to return to this yet.

I believe that where I'd got up to was implementing INotifyPropertyChanged and the way I had some core structure going on.

Not all the classes are staying.

I wanted to use reflection for loading appropriate DLLS for x86 vs Arm (Raspberry Pi).

I want to implement Google's Authenticator API for SMS.

I think I haven't included any x509 stuff here ... I was working on that initially in a separate project.

This isn't something that works yet ... needs a LOT of work!
